                        Halloween Horror Houses presented by Windsor Chamber of Commerce:
                        Collaborated and designed a dental office out of a bathroom.
                        A costumed actor dressed as a bloodied dentist would rev a drill at visitors passing by. A second actor festooned in bloody drool would howl in pain. 2003</span>
                        Created a morgue inside an office space. The morgue appeared as a wall of labeled drawers.
                        Costumed (dead) actors were encouraged to lie in the open drawers to frighten visitors as they passed through the room. 2004</span>
                        Created a Freak Show. Developed and costumed several acts that included Swamp Thing, Mole boy, and Pumpkin Head. 
                        The costumed characters performed on top of desks partitioned off with theatrical curtains.
                        A barker led visitors to the different stages to be entertained with frolicking freakdom. 2005</span>
